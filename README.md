# Charlie Kirk Investigation
## Review of Possible Explanations

### Is there actual code? Why? What the heck is this...
No, there is no code. This is essentially a Google Doc.

### Why GitHub?
Because this is an ongoing, ever-changing analysis, the information herein shall improve continuously. Transparency in how and why these changes are made is a priority. Git's tracking system is the best way to...

- Make it clear when and why changes were made
- Allow others to directly propose changes through the fork/PR process

### Preface
The official narrative was asserted with extremely high confidence and specificity within about 33 hours of the shooting. This was objectively premature. Granting it the title “Official Narrative” overstates the authority from which it came. Here, it will be regarded as nothing more than one theory of many.

Unlike universally respected investigative bodies such as the NTSB, which is focused on prevention, the US criminal justice system is focused on blame. At respected investigative bodies, evidence is collected first, experiments are conducted next, and conclusions follow months or even years later. But within the criminal justice system, conclusions come first and evidence comes months or even years later.

The purpose of this report is prevention and fact finding. Not blame. Evidence first.
