# On Alleged Bullet Capture on Video
Some say a bullet or projectile of some kind was captured behind victim in 3 frames immediately before victim was hit. 


### Evidence For:
- Each sample of the object has it in a very straight line
- The straight line appears to point at victim's neck
- In direct sunlight, a camera without dynamic iris stuck wide open may capture a lower-speed bullet since their only useful throttle in direct sun is shutter speed.


### Analysis of Evidence:
Must position the object in 3D space to verify anything. 


### Evidence Against:
- The shapes of the samples are not consistent with confirmed examples of bullets/vapor trails caught on cameras. They are usually longer and less rigidly defined.
- The samples do not occur through time in the expected sequence, right to left. Instead, the first sample seen is the middle, then the rightmost, then the leftmost.
- The supposed shooting location for the alleged projectile is the roof of the tunnel, which is not a feasible shooting location


### Conclusion:
Some say the reason the samples are out of sequence is due to video compression. To overrule common sense, this explanation must be validated by one of the 2 or 3 developers on the planet who understand the innerworkings of the exact video compression used in this video at the C++ level. Since such an oppurtunity is not practical, it is best to assume the simplest explanation, which is that the camera observed light where it said it did when it said it did. Other problems such as the implausible shooting location make this theory quite weak.
