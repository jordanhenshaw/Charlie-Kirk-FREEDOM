# On Alleged Bullet Capture on Video
Some say a bullet or projectile of some kind was captured behind victim in 3 frames immediately before victim was hit. 


### Evidence For:
- Each sample of the object has it in a very straight line
- The straight line appears to point at victim's neck
- In direct sunlight, a camera without dynamic iris stuck wide open may capture a lower-speed bullet since their only useful throttle in direct sun is shutter speed.


### Analysis of Evidence:
Must position the object in 3D space to verify anything. 


### Evidence Against:
- The shapes of the samples are not consistent with confirmed examples of bullets/vapor trails caught on cameras. They are usually longer and less rigidly defined.
- The samples do not occur through time in the expected sequence, right to left. Instead, the first sample seen is the middle, then the rightmost, then the leftmost.
- The supposed shooting location for the alleged projectile is the roof of the tunnel, which is not a feasible shooting location
- Allegedly, 2 different versions of the video with the evidence have surfaced, both with completely different frame rates. This dramatically compromises the chain of custody for the footage, as it makes it impossible to know if Adobe After Effects, or some similar video compositor, was involved between the raw footage and the evidence we have. We must have the raw footage when making claims about specks.


### On the Claim That Bullet Was 500 ft/s
- Evidence of cavitation is observed directly in other footage. Some say the evidence of cavitation is actually just motion blur made possible by ND filters and dynamic iris (DSLR), but the camera that recorded that footage has not been identified (to the best of the knowledge available here) and motion blur would only be expected in the case of cavitation.
- Cavitation is the only known plausible explanation for the bizarre shirt behavior and for the apparent necklace/cross being rapidly flung off the neck while pulling the shirt dramatically up nearly to the height of the nose.
- Cavitation of human neck rules out subsonic round.
- ChatGPT was allegedly used to approximate the physical, actual distance between the specks.
- There is no evidence any attempt was made to place the specks in a virtual 3D environment.
- Therefore, the 500 ft/s claim is poorly evidenced.
- Claim that victim was wearing an earpiece at the time of the crime is definitively and conclusively and exhaustively ruled out by Exhibit 11, and a cornocopia of other high resolution photographs and videos showing no oppurtunity to add an earpiece between when the high resolution photographs were taken and the time of the crime. The object shown flying off the neck area could have only been the necklace, clearly evident in the photographs and videos.


### On Video Compression:
Some say the reason the samples are out of sequence is due to video compression. To overrule common sense, this explanation must be validated by either identifying the software bug in the C++ source code or by reproducing the artifact signature in comparable scenarios, such as a small bird flying quickly in the distance. Because we do not have the raw footage, the task of even locating the exact codec/compression used, and much less the exact build/hash, is practically impossible. Therefore the only likely option is to make a general statement about the codec/compression/format that was likely used and compare that to other footage with similar artifacts using that codec. However the level of certainty that can be reached is likely quite small.


### Conclusion:
Must position the object in 3D space to verify anything. Please see the current level of progress on that front below. More detailed 3D reconstruction will follow. Shooting angle remains the biggest hurdle for this theory. However, must redo the 3D reconstruction acknowledging that the specks could represent an object anywhere on a straight line coming from the sensor and going through the speck and out to the first obstacle (could be a gnat an inch from the lens or could be super far away, or could be at the intuitive distance right behind victim.)
