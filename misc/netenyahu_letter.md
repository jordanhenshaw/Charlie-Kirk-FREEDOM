# On the Authenticity of the Netanyahu Letter
Some say that the published letter from the desk of Charlie Kirk to Israel’s Prime Minister was not authored by Charlie Kirk, or was at least doctored.

### Evidence in Support:
- The letter uses the term “social media” 37 times
- Mr. Kirk used the term only once when giving parallel advice to CA Gov. Newsom
- The letter uses PR terminology atypical of a CEO’s vernacular such as 
“REVAMP”
“Rapid Response Media Team”
“Information warriors”
“Effective messaging”
“Effective messaging campaign”
“Clearly defined message”
“Social media influencers”
“Paradigm shift”
“PR challenges”
“One stop shopping resource”
“ORIGINAL home grown content”
“Revamped information war strategy”
- Mr. Kirk used 0 of the above terms when giving parallel advice to CA Gov. Newsom
- The letter generally reads like generic PR consultant’s report.
- Mr. Kirk’s PR is sharing ideas organically, not social media campaigns.

### Analysis of Evidence:
Writing style inconsistent with Mr. Kirk’s known speech, occupation, and strategies.

### Conclusion:
Strong stylometric inconsistencies between the letter and Mr. Kirk’s speech in a comparable context indicates the letter was likely authored at least in part by a PR consultant, not by Mr. Kirk. Mr. Kirk’s level of involvement in the letter is unknown.
