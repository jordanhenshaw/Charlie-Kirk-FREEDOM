# Released Text Messages Fake?
Some say that the text messages released by the FBI are inauthentic.

### Evidence in Support:
- They contain police terms such as “vehicle”, “squad car”, “sweep”, and “drop point”
- They over-share highly incriminating details
- They contain knowledge of an interrogation only police should have

### Analysis of Evidence:
The texts do have indicators of police-authorship.

### Evidence Against:
- Some social media users indicate that people similar to Robison do talk like this

### Conclusion:
The jury may be easily persuaded that the text messages are not reliable for fact-finding.
