# On The Hamptons Meeting
There was allegedly a meeting over Zoom the night before the crime in which the victim allegedly sought advice from Josh Hammer and others on how to best respond to college student questions on Israel.

### Relevance
Some speculate this meeting was a sort of "intervention" regarding victim's recent turn from supporting Israel.

### Advice Seeking?
Some claim that victim was of too high status to seek advice from someone of the stature of Josh Hammer.

#### Evidence For:
- Victim seeking advice from others of less status than himself is consistent with his relationship with Dr. Frank Turek. According to Dr. Turek, and as confirmed by an interview between Dr. Turek and victim, victim habitually and earnestly improves his craft by picking the brains of those with greater specialization in certain topics.

#### Evidence Against:
- Hammer reposted/retweeted a years-old tweet/X-post of President Trump regarding public executions apparently shortly after the meeting. No context was provided by Hammer. Possible context was the killer of a girl on a train, but other posts by Hammer that day do not suggest this context was on his mind.

### Conclusion:
Inconclusive. No strong reason to doubt the claim; no strong evidence in support or against.
