# Audience Obstructed Losee Center LOS
Some speculate that when the audience members were present around the victim's tent, they would have obstructed the line of sight (LOS) from the Losee Center roof and would have thus prevented a possibility of a shot.


### Evidence For:
- Exhibit 5 shows that audience members in fact could significantly obstruct the view of victim even to elevated onlookers

### Analysis of Evidence:
Requires detailed reconstruction of the Exhibit 5 photo in 3D to compare to the Losee Center location.


### Evidence Against:
- Exhibit 7 approximates a slope downward of 6 degrees in Exhibit 5

- Exhibit 8 approximates Exhibit 5's focal length at around 90 mm since the sizes of both tents appear the same. This assumes the actual size of both tents are the same.

- Exhibit 9 demonstrates that the audience members obstructing the view of Exhibit 5 must be quite close to the tent in order to obstruct its view of the tent the way they do.

- Exhibit 10 demonstrates that a person must be standing under the tent or must be taller than the tent in order to obstruct LOS to victim for a Losee Center shooting position.

- Exhibit 1 shows that the pentagon shape of the courtyard means that audience members between victim and Losee Center position are not elevated by the pitch of the arena until much farther back than for the position of Exhibit 5. In other words, the ground stays flat much farther directly in front of victim compared to on the sides.

### Conclusion:
Tentatively ruled out, but must gather data from the ground to confirm the precision of the rough 3D model is within acceptable tolerances.
