# On Google Searches
Some say that Google Trends data indicates that key search terms related to the crime were searched in Washington DC and in Israel in an anomolous manner months, days before the crime was commmited, and that this indicates foreknowledge of said crime.


### Evidence For:
- Screenshots showing spikes for certain countries at the described times


### Analysis of Evidence:
Is worth investigating further, but the results must be reproducible and conclusions must be drawn from an exhaustive, statistical analysis with an appropriately wide scope. That is, not focusing only one 1 or 2 countries and the important search terms, but "getting a baseline" so to speak.


### Evidence Against;
- Initial attempts to reproduce could not achieve consistent results. The same search term and settings occasionally produced no results and occasionally produced data indicating a spike. 


### Conclusion:
There are approximately 5 billion internet users worldwide, and the majority use Google search. This amounts to approximately 5 trillion Google searches per year. Any analysis of Google Search data intending to find a link between specific search terms and specific individuals from a specific country or region absolutely must be performed by an expert properly qualified to interpret the data.

This page will remain inconclusive until such an expert comes forward.
