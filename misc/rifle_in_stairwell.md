# Rifle was not Present in Stairwell Photos?
Some say that the individual pictured in the stairwell in the photo released by authorities cannot possibly have the reported rifle on his person.

### Evidence in Support: 
- Both legs are bent at different times
- There are no bulges in his clothing where a rifle would be expected
- Even when broken down, the 2 halves of the rifle are far too long to fit in backpack

### Analysis of Evidence:
It is likely possible to hide the rifle by taking it apart and putting one half in each pant leg right above the knee cap.

### Evidence Against:
- YouTuber demonstrated the photos could be reproduced while hiding the same rifle

### Conclusion:
While the clothing the YouTuber wore were much more baggy than what is seen in the photos, it is likely that this transportation/hiding method was viable.
