# Rifle was Not Present in Rooftop Egress Footage?
Some say that a rifle cannot be seen in the footage where a figure runs across and jumps off the Losee Center roof and that the rifle therefore was not on the individual’s person.

### Evidence in Support:
- There appears to be a towel, but not necessarily a long stick-like object

### Analysis of Evidence:
Seems fairly compelling when watched in real time.

### Evidence Against:
- Playing the footage back in very slow motion, frame by frame, reveals a short stick

### Conclusion: 
There does appear to be a stick-like object, but it’s very questionable whether it can be long enough to be the reported Mauser rifle. While pixel density may explain why a thin muzzle may not come through in the footage, one would expect to see at least one frame where a much longer stick is clear. The footage appears to be consistent with a .22 caliber rifle.
