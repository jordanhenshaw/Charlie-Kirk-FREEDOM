# Parking Lot Security Cam Footage Doctored?
Some say that the security camera  footage depicting figure exiting the roof was doctored.

### Evidence in Support:
- People walking in background disappear after walking behind a tree, possible AI
- The figureâ€™s shadow disappears after entering a brighter section of roof

### Analysis of Evidence:
The people walked down a staircase. 

The shadow was no longer visible because the highlights of the brighter section of roof were blown out/overexposed. The shadow was no longer visible because the brightness of the roof and of the shadow exceeded the dynamic range of the camera, so information of the shadow was lost.

### Conclusion:
No known standing reason to suspect doctoring or AI involvement.
