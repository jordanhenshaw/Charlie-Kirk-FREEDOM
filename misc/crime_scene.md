# Crime Scene Disturbance Concern
Some say that the crime scene, specifically the tent of the crime and the area and the tent of the crime, was not properly secured by police line soon enough—or even at all—after the crime, and that the University proceeded with extensive renovations in the immediate area almost immediately after the crime.


### Evidence For:
- Shortly after the crime, at least one unaffiliated individual was seen stealing hats directly from the table in the tent
- Shortly after the crime, a TPUSA staff member was seen tampering with a camera inside the tent that almost certainly recorded key aspects of the crime that are material to the investigation.
- Shortly after the crime, a TPUSA staff member was seen moving the chair that victim sat on during the crime.


### Analysis of Evidence:
The evidence conclusively demonstrates that the crime scene was definitively not secured by law enforcement for a consequential amount of time after the crime.


### Evidence Against:
- Police staffing issues are likely to blame for a slow response to secure crime seen fast enough.
- Other priorities, such as the need to evacuate civilians and the need to hunt down the killer, likely outweighed the need to protect the crime scene in the first 5 minutes.
- Police did secure the crime scene shortly afterwards.


### Conclusion:
Law enforcement did not act fast enough to secure the crime scene from all meaningful interference, but this was likely due to staffing shortages and conflicting priorities. The university did renovate significant parts of the crime scene after the crime, but likely only after the campus was completely shut down for several days to nearly a week. During that shut down, investigation activies likely excavated large portions of the landscape for lab analysis off-site. The university's decision to renovate immediately was likely involuntary, as the area was likely severely disturbed by forensics and evidence collection. No malice or negligence can be inferred here on the part of the university or law enforcement.
