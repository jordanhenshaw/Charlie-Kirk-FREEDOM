# Follow-ups
This page is intended for seeking outside help to collect evidence, to offer expert analysis, or to perform field tests.


- Requesting parallel interviews with both the audience member who last spoke to victim and with the security gaurd immediately to victim's right at the time of the shooting. Ask, "When the shot came, did you hear a hiss?" If security gaurd says yes and crowd member says no, then the shot came from the tunnel. If the opposite, the shot came from the front. If neither or both say yes, the result is inconclusive.

- Requesting ballistics test using an AK-47 caliber rifle shooting at ballistics dummy with a neck wearing a comparable cross pendant on a necklace with a shirt on. Please attempt to reproduce the action of the necklace/cross depicted in the footage. Please also try to reproduce the apparent swish of air observed travleing through the shirt. Use this reproduction to see if the footage is more consistent with a shot from in front or with a shot from behind. 

- Requesting on-site video exterior examination of the Sparks Automotive building to determine if the building is or was recently under construction and if its height has increased since Google Earth imagery and terrain data as of September, 2025.

- Requesting that the appropriate law enforcement and medical authorities rule out beyond any question the possibility of a hidden, very hard-to-spot entry wound on the back of victim's head, beneath the hair.

- Requesting that the appropriate law enforcement authorities track down the registration of the van in the tunnel if this has not been done already.
