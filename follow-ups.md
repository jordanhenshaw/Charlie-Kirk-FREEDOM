# Follow-ups
This page is intended for seeking outside help to collect evidence, to offer expert analysis, or to perform field tests.


- Requesting parallel interviews with both the audience member who last spoke to victim and with the security gaurd immediately to victim's right at the time of the shooting. Ask, "When the shot came, did you hear a hiss?" If security gaurd says yes and crowd member says no, then the shot came from the tunnel. If the opposite, the shot came from the front. If neither or both say yes, the result is inconclusive.

- Recommending ballistics test (~$3k):
  - Small caliber, high velocity rifle with silencer
  - Ballistics dummy of upper torso with skeletal system
  - Dummy wears shirt and a necklace with a cross pendant
  - Shoot from dummy's 4-5 o'clock position aiming at bottom of skull
  - Use high speed camera to film behavior of shirt and necklace
  - Take note of bullet's path and of any damage to front neck by the cross pendant

- Requesting on-site video exterior examination of the Sparks Automotive building to determine if the building is or was recently under construction and if its height has increased since Google Earth imagery and terrain data as of September, 2025.

- Requesting that the appropriate law enforcement and medical authorities rule out beyond any question the possibility of a hidden, very hard-to-spot entry wound on the back of victim's head, beneath the hair.

- Requesting that the appropriate law enforcement authorities track down the registration of the van in the tunnel if this has not been done already.

- We really, really need a public, age-restricted database with as much of the original, raw, uncut footage as possible. This is really important for being able to quickly find the main angles without having to search across 50 different heavily edited X videos each time.

- Monitor the relevant county website in Arizona for probate information, especially for written documentation of Mr. Kirk's formally appointed successor as CEO of Turning Point, USA.
