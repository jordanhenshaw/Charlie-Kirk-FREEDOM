# Exculpatory Evidence
If this project results in information or evidence that, by itself and without our argumentation, is highly likely to lead to the actual exoneration of anyone charged with a crime, we are morally, ethically, and personally obligated to share it directly with the authorities by all lawful and appropriate means. List candidates of such evidence below respective to whomever would be exonerated. If a candidate is confirmed beyond reasonable doubt, immediately share it directly with the authorities by all lawful and appropriate means


### DO NOT
Do not list information that is almost certainly already known by the authorities. For example, commentary on how a .30-06 round does not do the damage seen in footage of the crime. Only list evidence that is otherwise hidden well out of plain sight.


### With regards to the charges against Tyler Robinson:
Unconfirmed Candidates:
- Possible photo(s) of a rifle with a silencer in a van behind the victim with line of sight to victim at time of crime.
- Entry wound in victim's head in the rear.
- If there are scrapes, cuts, or gashes on victim's chest beneath the apparent neck wound, it would validate the speculation that the wound was caused not by a bullet coming from the front, but by the cross pendant. If confirmed, the reasoning for placing the shooter in front quickly evaporates.


Confirmed (share with authorities immediately): 
- [None]
