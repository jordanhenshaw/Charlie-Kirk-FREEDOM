# Code of Conduct

## 1. Neutrality and Purpose
This repository is dedicated to **fact-finding and prevention**, not blame. To preserve the integrity and legal safety of this work, all contributors must adhere to the following principles when discussing, modifying, or submitting work.

- The objective is **fact-finding and prevention**, not advocacy, partisanship, or blame.  
- Content should aim to clarify, test, and refine ALL explanations — not to promote your favorite theory.  
- Avoid emotionally charged or politicized framing: this project’s credibility depends on analytical neutrality.

---

## 2. Evidence-Based Contribution
- All statements, hypotheses, or claims should be grounded in **verifiable evidence** (for example, video frames, public records, or contemporaneous media).  
- Use qualifiers such as *“appears,” “may indicate,”* or *“cannot be confirmed.”* instead of conjugations of "to be" such as *"is," "are," "was,"* and *"were".*
- Do not include or link to information not already lawfully public.

---

## 3. Legal Compliance
- Do not upload, share, or link to any material that could violate privacy laws, ongoing investigations, copyright, or confidentiality agreements.  
- Do not post identifiable personal data about private individuals.  
- Respect all applicable laws regarding defamation, evidence handling, and data protection.  
- Contributors are individually responsible for ensuring their submissions comply with these standards.
- Add the legal disclaimer paragraph to the top of any file that could possibly be construed to defame a specific, living individual and do not defame.

---

## 4. Transparency and Attribution
- Use Git commits and pull requests to explain your reasoning clearly.  
- Cite sources wherever possible. If information is unverified, label it as such.  
- Use commit history to track and explain updates.

---

## 5. Enforcement
- The repository maintainers may edit, remove, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct or pose legal or ethical risk.  
- Serious violations — including defamatory content or targeted harassment — may result in a ban from participation or a report to GitHub Trust & Safety.

---

## 6. Copycat Facilitation
- Do not provide information that is not readily accessible in the public domain that can facilitate copycats to commit other crimes more successfully in the future. For example, do not share niche information about any potential security vulnerabilities of any specific building, building type, or campus type. If such information is consequential, replace all sensitive words with *[CENSORED]*.

---

## 7. Reaching Conclusions
- Do not come to final conclusions until all evidence is in. If it takes a year or two years, that is okay. These cases are not solved in 33 hours. Prevention requires accuracy, not speed.

## 8. Acknowledgment
By contributing to this repository, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct and understand that this is a **public, research-oriented workspace**, not a forum for advocacy or accusation.  
All analysis remains provisional and subject to revision as evidence develops.
