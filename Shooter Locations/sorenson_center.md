# Sorenson Center Theory
A shooter enters the unlocked and unsupervised [REDACTED], climbs to the [REDACTED], and gains access to Sorenson Center roof through one of the [REDACTED]. They then take a somewhat acceptable sniper position that does not reveal their position to casual onlookers. They are likely dressed or cloaked in all white to blend in with the roof. They then take the shot. They exit the same way they came.
(Some information is redacted to avoid bringing the attention of copycats to an obscure security vulnerability common to many similar facilities. I can share this information in private off the record.)

### Supporting Evidence:
- 1-2 people in crowd shortly after the shot appear to point in this direction.
- Distance to victim consistent with audio delay.
- Slope roughly consistent with Surgeon’s report.

### Analysis of Evidence:
Generally weak. Relies heavily on unconfirmed and unspecific Surgeon’s report. If rifle is confirmed to not be .30-06, the Losee Center is the preferred location for the mystery rifle. If rifle is proven to be .30-06, this position is preferred for the .30-06 rifle.

### Opposing Evidence:
- [None known]

### Conclusion: 
Strong backup option if Losee Center as shooting position is falsified by autopsy.
