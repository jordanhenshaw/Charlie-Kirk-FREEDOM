# Sparks Automotive Theory
A shooter fires the shot from the unoccupied, unsecured, under-construction Sparks Automotive building.

### Conclusion: 
According to terrain data from Google Earth, no line of sight to victim’s location from this location is possible. 

However, footage of this building the day of the crime is limited. Since the theory states the building was under construction at the time of the crime, it is possible the structure’s height changed since the last update to Google Earth’s data and thus provides line of sight. However, aerial photos at time of crime do not suggest recent major structural changes to the structure’s height.

Unless compelling evidence supporting line of sight arises, theory is conclusively ruled out.
