# Drone Shooter Theory
The shot came from a military-grade drone deployed from and recovered by a plane.

### Evidence in Support:
- A plane flew extremely low, slow loops over area before and immediately after crime
- That aircraft’s type is associated with a US Army drone deployment program, HADES
- That aircraft’s exact tail number is directly associated with HADES
- Drone-like objects were filmed over scene at time of crime from multiple angles

### Analysis of Evidence:
Evidence does not suggest ISR or C-UAS assets were deployed at the scene. ISR or C-UAS drones deployed from a HADES-type platform would be deployed and recovered at altitude, not at 200’ AGL. The possible drones captured on video exhibit flight characteristics that are not consistent with equipment that would be deployed via HADES.

### Opposing Evidence:
- The aircraft seems to have been delivered to the US Army the day of the crime.

### Conclusion:
The low, slow loops were most likely part of Acceptance Flight Tests flown to ensure the aircraft was in expected condition for delivery. None of the evidence actually leads to the conclusion that it participated in any covert military operation over UVU.
