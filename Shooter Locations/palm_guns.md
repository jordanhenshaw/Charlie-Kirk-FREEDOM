# Palm Guns Theory
A team of plainclothes security personnel fire palm guns, phone guns, and similar devices at victim, synchronized to a sniper shot overhead by hand signals.

### Supporting Evidence:
- At least 3 security persons are seen making deliberate hand movements all at the precise moment of the shot.

### Analysis of Evidence:
Highly suspicious, but not conclusive or specific.

### Opposing Evidence:
- Wound on victim grossly inconsistent with weapon caliber.
- No clear muzzle flash.
- Little to no recoil.
- Nearby crowd behavior inconsistent with use of firearm in immediate area.

### Conclusion:
Observations do not lead to desired conclusion, but remain suspicious.
