# Van in Tunnel Theory
A shooter fires the shot from the trunk of a van parked in the tunnel at victim's 4-5 o'clock while a remote trigger system simultaneously triggers the rifle on the Losee Center roof to mask the sound from the tunnel. The bullet ricochets downwards off the bottom of the victim's skull down into and through C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6, and stopping in C7.


### Evidence For:
- Van's rear trunk door appears to open right before the shot and then close again right after the shot.
- A van is an exceptional shooting position that avoids leaving any evidence, avoids cameras, and provides a clean getaway.
- A man standing outside the van around the time of the shot appears to be trying to block the crowd's view of the van around the time of the shot
- This shooting position best explains the damage to victim's C2-C7
- In the camera angle originating from victim's 3 o'clock, the rear scalp appears to be the first part of victim's body disturbed by the shot


### Analysis of Evidence:
This theory appears to do the best job of explaining how no evidence was left by a second shooter and the very bizarre spinal damage pattern.


### Evidence Against:
- The wound on the front of victim's left neck, while it may be related to the cross pendant, was so deep that it appeared to include a severed coratid and/or severed jugular. Those wounds do not seem to be consistent with simply being slapped violently by a cross pendant. Theory must explain why this wound appeared to be so devastating if the proposed origin was simply jewelry. Perhaps the cavitation at the same time made the flesh significantly more susceptible to such damage.
- The round allegedly used at this shooting position must be of dramatically lower caliber than that used on the Losee Center roof by the alleged patsy. Theory must explain why such different rifles were chosen if the goal was to incriminate the patsy.
- Candace Owens appears to have sources close to the matter and has become positively convinced that the shot came from the front as a result of talking to her sources close to the matter. Theory must explain why autopsy and/or ME failed to identify an entry wound on the back of victim's head.


### Conclusion:
This theory has relatively minor holes, but appears to do the best job of explaining what all other theories cannot: the bizarre spinal damage, and the question of it is was a second shooter then why was no evidence left behind in any of the footage or in any audience reactions. The smoking gun in this matter is recoil. All other theories proposing a shooter either caught on camera within the crowd must show evidence of substantial recoil and of substantial audience reaction to it, and they do not. This theory hides the recoil, evades all cameras, and places the shooter well away from audience members who might alert to the shooting location.
