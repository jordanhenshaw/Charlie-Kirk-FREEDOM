# Hall of Flags Area (South End) Theory
A sniper fires a shot from this general area.

### Supporting Evidence:
- Extremely fuzzy photo of bush.
- Possible muzzle flash in area.
- Possible bullet captured on video coming from this direction.
- At least one eyewitness believed they heard the shot come from here.

### Analysis of Evidence:
Quite weak, heavily reliant on smudges in heavily pixelated footage.

### Opposing Evidence:
- Bullet path grossly inconsistent with Surgeon’s report.
- Area where muzzle flash is seen unsuitable firing location per foot traffic inside.

### Conclusion:
Too little evidence to overturn Surgeon’s report.
