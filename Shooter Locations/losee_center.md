# Losee Center Theory
A shooter hops over a short fence from a pedestrian area onto the roof. Shooter then assembles long rifle, a Mauser .30-06. Shooter then approaches shooting area and is seen by a civilian camera. Shooter then takes the shot. Egress is filmed from many cameras starting at 3 seconds following the shot.

### Supporting Evidence: 
- Civilian footage depicting a figure in prone position with a shot shortly before shot.
- CCTV footage depicting a figure running across the roof and jumping off it.
- Civilian footage depicting a figure running across the roof 3 seconds after shot.
- The only visible external wound on Kirk is roughly consistent with shot from here.
- Several civilians appear to look in this direction after the shot.

### Analysis of Evidence: 
Strongly suggestive, but not conclusive. No direct evidence of a weapon in this position. 

### Opposing Evidence: 
- Rifle should be seen on CCTV but is not seen. Smaller, shorter rifle may be seen.
- Slope to victim inconsistent with Surgeonâ€™s report.
- Distance to victim inconsistent with audio delay.
- Wound on victim inconsistent with rifle caliber.
- Exhibit 6 indicates line of sight to victim from a different angle/position was significantly obstructed by audience members.

### Conclusion:
Evidence is generally inconsistent with the named rifle, but shooting position may hold if ground survey rules out obstructio of line of sight by audience members.
