# Lavalier Microphone Theory
An improvised firearm hidden in the battery compartment of victimâ€™s magnet-supported lavalier mic device fires a projectile, causing the death of victim.

### Supporting Evidence:
- Undefined shirt behavior seems to indicate forces beginning under shirt, not outside
- Precedent for this class of device overseas, albeit in the form of simple bomb

### Analysis of Evidence:
Extreme cavitation of neck in a thousandth of a second paired with center of shirt catching on the necklace-hung cross is much better explanation for the bizarre shirt behavior.

### Opposing Evidence:
- Wound on victim grossly inconsistent with weapon caliber
- No clear muzzle flash.
- Negative recoil.

### Conclusion:
Conclusively ruled out per negative recoil and scale of wound.
