# Style Guide
This repo is intended for people who do not code. Accordingly, only use hashtags for visual heirarchy levels. Only use html formatting for images. Avoid complex markdown formatting wherever possible. If your grandmother wouldn't know how to finish/copy the pattern, it's too complicated.

In folders containing many parallel files, such as Suspects, look to other files in the folder for the rules on exactly how new files in that folder should be laid out.
