# On Mossad as Suspect
Some people speculate that Mossad carried out this assassination because Kirk changed his views on Israel shortly before his passing.

### Supporting Evidence:
- Victim allegedly stated to 3 people that [likely Mossad] was going to kill him 24 hours prior
- Text messages sent by victim indicate ending support for Israel 48 hours prior
- Statements made by victim indicated he felt attacked by Israel in months prior
- Mossad is known for high-tech secret assasinations on foriegn political figures
- Israel has struck US in decades prior with no consequence (USS Liberty incident)
- Candace Owens speculates 2 foreign operatives were close to the crime
- Mossad’s MO utilizes foreign operatives to conduct foreign assassinations
- Kirk’s security team—for that day only—allegedly has ties to Israel
- Israel’s media behavior shifted significantly in the month following the crime
- Kirk allegedly refused a $150 million dollar gift from Israel shortly before the crime
- Kirk allegedly refused an invitation to Israel shortly before the crime

### Analysis of Evidence:
None of the evidence directly leads to the hypothesis. However, the evidence builds a circumstantial case against Mossad.

### Evidence Against:
- [None known]

### Conclusion:
Cannot be ruled out, but not appropriately evidenced either. Given the hypothesis, we would not expect to have clear evidence, so it is internally unfalsifiable to an extent. As such, it cannot be asserted nor contested with due certainty until more facts are verified. Getting the 3 witnesses to come forward would lend extensive credence to this theory.
