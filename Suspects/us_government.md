# On US Government as Suspect
Some speculate that a 3-letter agency within the US government assassinated Kirk to prevent him from rising to the top of the presidential ticket in the 2028 general election.

### Supporting Evidence:
- The FBI investigation from the outside appears to be rife with blunders

### Analysis of Evidence:
This evidence can be explained by a flawed justice system focused on blame before facts.

### Evidence Against:
- Nearly the entire presidential cabinet attended Kirkâ€™s memorial service

### Conclusion:
No strong reason to pursue, but cannot be ruled out.
