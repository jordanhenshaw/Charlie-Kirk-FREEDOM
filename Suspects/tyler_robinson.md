# On Tyler Robinson as a Suspect
Law Enforcement claims Tyler Robinson is responsible for firing the shot.

### Supporting Evidence:
- Robinson’s gun was found in a bush outside the campus.
- A screwdriver allegedly with Robinson's DAN on it was found on a roof.
- Messages that appear to be sent from Robinson’s phone that confess to the crime.
- Blurry image of a man in a stairwell.
- Blurry video of a man running across a roof and jumping off.
- Blurry videos of a man or multiple men walking.

### Analysis of Evidence:
The only evidence that supports the conclusion are the text messages. These text messages are unlikely to be authentic due to irregular word choice and due to unnatural oversharing of highly incriminating information.

### Opposing Evidence:
- The caliber of Robinson’s gun is not consistent with the wound on the victim.
- Robinson turns himself into police to avoid SWAT, but does not confess.

### Conclusion:
The autopsy may cause Robinson’s charges to be dropped. Prosecuting current charges beyond reasonable doubt is likely impossible regardless. The entirety of the case hinges on text messages that appear to be fabricated. This case fails at preliminary hearing. Robinson’s behavior, turning himself in to avoid a SWAT raid but not confessing, is consistent with the falsely accused.
